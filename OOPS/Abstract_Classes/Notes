// Abstract Classes
> Parent class contains only body
> Child class will decide info of that method
> Overriding is there
> Any class that contains one or more abstract methods , must also be declared as abstract
> Every child class has to override all abstract methods in parent class
> You cannot create objects of parent class but can use parent as reference variable
> Cannot create Abstract constructors , can create constructors
> You cannot create abstract static methods as static methods cannot be overridden , abstract needs to overridden
> You can create static methods in abstract classes
> cannot have final abstract class bcoz final prevents inheritance
> Multiple inheritance is not there
> It can have normal method
> variables can be final or non final by default
> Abstract class cannot be instantiated
> Extends keyword

// Interfaces
> contain abstract functions
> variables are static and only final by default
> It cannot have normal method
> implements keyword
> which particular method to run is decided at run time
> two classes which are unrelated to each other can also implement same interface
