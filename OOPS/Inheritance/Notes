// Multiple Inheritance
--> one class extending more than one classes
--> Not allowed in Java
--> eg. let c be child class and A , B are parent class A has n=5 and inside B n=10 , then there will be ambiguity
     for c what is the value of n
--> overcome using interfaces

// Hierarchical Inheritance
--> one class is inherited by many classes
--> one parent multiple child's

// Hybrid Inheritance
--> combination of single and multiple inheritance
--> not in java check interfaces
